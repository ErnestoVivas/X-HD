This is a model of a wall cell of a moving boundary heat exchanger.
It supports two types of heat exchanger, i.e. direct-current and counter-current
heat exchangers. Both types are modelled by connecting the heat ports
of a secondary fluid cell with the heat ports of the wall cell. Then, 
a direct-current heat exchanger is modelled by using the secondary cell's fluid
ports in design direction and a counter-current heat exchanger is modelled by
using the secondary cell's fluid poirt against design direction.<br/><br/>
Validation models are stored in

AixLib.Fluid.HeatExchangers.MovingBoundaryHeatExchangers.Validation.WallCells.</a>
</p>
<h4>Assumptions</h4>
<p>
Some assumptions are used while modelling the wall cell. These
assumptions are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Considering the possibility of storing energy in the wall.
</li>
<li>
Assuming locally constant wall temperatures of each control
volume.
</li>
<li>
Assuming a constant density and specific heat capacity of the
wall's material.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The general modelling approach is based on the publication presented by
Bonilla et al. (2015). Thus, detailed information of the modelling assumptions
as well as the derivation of the equations of the model are given in the
publication of Bonilla et al.. The temperatures at the boundaries between the
different control volumes are computed with a weighted mean approach presented
by Zhand and Zhang (2006). Since this approach does not hold for inactive
control volumes, it is completed by adding a first-order delay element.
This delay element drifts the temperature of the inactive control volume
towards the temperature of the control volume next to it. The corresponding 
approach is proposed by Sangi et al. (2015).
