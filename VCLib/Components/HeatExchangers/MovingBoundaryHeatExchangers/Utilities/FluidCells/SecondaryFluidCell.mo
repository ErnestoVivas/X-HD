This is a model of the secondary fluid cell of a moving boundary heat exchanger.
It supports two types of heat exchanger, i.e. direct-current and counter-current
heat exchangers. A direct-current heat exchanger is modelled by using the fluid
ports in design direction and a counter-current heat exchanger is modelled by
usign the fluid poirt against design direction.<br/><br/>
Validation models are stored in

</p>
<h4>Assumptions</h4>
<p>
Some assumptions are used while modelling the secondary fluid cell. These
assumptions are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Neclecting the possibility of storing mass and energy.
</li>
<li>
Neglecting the momemtum accumulation.
</li>
<li>
Incompressible secondary fluid.
</li>
<li>
Assuming time-dependet but uniform pressure.
</li>
<li>
Average thermodynamic properties at each regime.
</li>
<li>
Thermodynamic properties leaving a regime are equal to the regime's average
thermodynamic properties.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The general modelling approach is based on the PhD thesis presented by
Gr&auml;ber (2013). Thus, detailed information of the modelling assumptions
as well as the derivation of the equations of the model are given in
Gr&auml;ber&apos;s dissertation.
