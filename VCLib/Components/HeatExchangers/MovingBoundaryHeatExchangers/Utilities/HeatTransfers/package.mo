This package contains different modellling approaches of the coefficient of
heat transfer. Currently, the following approaches are implemented within 
this package:

<ul>
<li>
<a href=\"modelica://AixLib.Fluid.HeatExchangers.MovingBoundaryHeatExchangers.Utilities.HeatTransfers.ConstantCoefficientOfHeatTransfer\">
ConstantCoefficientOfHeatTransfer:</a> This model provides a constant
coefficient of heat transfer. Thus, it is the most basic model.
