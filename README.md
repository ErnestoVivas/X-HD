# X-HD

X-HD is a framework to exploit heat pump system design methods. Therefore, we use three different design approaches: a heuristic-based method (HSM), an optimization-based method (OBM) and a simulation-based method (SBM). In this repository, we host the design approaches and share our code in order to accelerate the deployment of optimal designed heat pump systems for existing buildings.

A detailed description, source code and publications will follow soon.
