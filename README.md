# X-HD

X-HD is a framework to exploit heat pump system design methods. Therefore, we use three different design approaches: a heuristic-based method (HSM), an optimization-based method (OBM) and a simulation-based method (SBM). In this repository, we host the design approaches and share our code in order to accelerate the deployment of optimal designed heat pump systems for existing buildings.

Idealised bivalent heat pump heating system based on two typical hydraulic structures. Models for components are taken from library AixLib: https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib

A detailed description and publications will follow soon.
